Write a paragraph or two describing the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database in terms of:

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage 
The minimum RTO for a single AZ outage is typically under 2 minute for most AWS database services that support Multi-AZ deployments.

Total time: 2 minutes

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage

The minimum RTO for a single region outage is about a few minutes to a 60 minutes.

Total time: 60 minutes 

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
The minimum RPO for a single AZ outage under 1 second for most AWS database services that support Multi-AZ deployments, as they use synchronous or physical replication to a second AZ.

Total time: under 1 second
       
4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage 
The minimum RPO could range from 10 to 40 minutes, though some technologies offer near-zero RPO capabilities.

Total time: 40 minutes
